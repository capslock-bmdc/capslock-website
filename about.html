<h1> Capslock From the Students for the Students</h1>
<h2>a bit about us</h2>
<p>Capslock is a movement that was founded by some bocherim of BMDC who want to
help the yeshiva accomplish it's goal of bringing chareidim into the work force.
The first issue they had to solve was how to motivate guys to learn how to program
, which they did through the use of hackatons. A hackaton is an all night programing
session where teams fight to create the best product/answer and learn a lot during
the competition and the hipe leading to it.</p>

<h2>how you can help</h2>

<h2>our goal for the future</h2>
