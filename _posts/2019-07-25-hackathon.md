We just got started! The idea of a community and a hackathon came around the same time, we decided to merge them and showcase the community to the students through the hackathon.

Because this is our first hackathon, we were hesitated to give the students a big task - the aim was to give them the feeling of accomplishment and the courage to continue developing. Therefore we decided not to make it a theme-based competition, but a progress-based competition. Each team had a pre-defined task, it was something fun but challenging. Every team also had a 'Team Mentor', a graduated that helped them plan before the hackathon and mentored them throughout the night.

The hackathon started pretty late, at nine pm. But by then everyone was pumped-up and ready to get coding. The truth is that we had activities planned for the night, we didn't think the students would be capable of coding for a full night without any breaks. But the students where really in the zone, except for a short break for pizza, they were coding for most of the night.

There were four teams, and as mentioned, each one had a different challenge. One team worked with REST APIs, another created a web app, and two built Android applications. The dev-talk that was going on was so high, everyone was learning something new all the time. And these are students that didn't have any practical experience in coding, only the theory that they are learning in college.

In the end, a team that created an app that notifies the user before sunset got the highest on the criteria chart, and won a meal at Borgers-Place!

Everyone enjoyed and learned so much - that the planning for the next hackathon and other activities have started. See you then!
